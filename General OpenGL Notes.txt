General OpenGL Notes

glUseProgram is the "Bind" of shaders

Typical systems have 32 texture slots (mobile has less (8))

GLSL	opengl programming lang
	int, float, double,  bool, uint
	
    vecn: default vector of n floats.
    bvecn: vector of n booleans.
    ivecn: vector of n integers.
    uvecn: vector of n unsigned integers.
    dvecn: vector of n double components.

	Swizzling
		vec2 someVec;
		vec4 differentVec = someVec.xyxx;
		vec3 anotherVec = differentVec.zyw;
		vec4 otherVec = someVec.xxxx + anotherVec.yxzy;
		
	Normalized Device Coordinates
		Final coordinate system mapped to the screen
			0,0 is at center of screen
			x: -1 to 1
			y: -1 to 1
		
	3 main Projection Matrices
		Model View Projection
			Model: objects transform TRS(translation | rotation | scale) 
			View: Simulates Camera: (Position | Rotation |Scale)
			Projection
		position is multiplied by each to get the final render position
